# Improvements



Remove grey, all white

top panel always visible as opposed to scroll down and eventually see it. Like https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html

Remove all github links in the bottom panel.

IEP logo always visible in the top right of the panel, decide where an appropriate place for the search icon is.

On my monitor, there is too much whitespace on right hand side, dont thave the toc completely left justified, but less whitespace, more main panel, bootstrapped though. Look at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html they use real estate more efficiently left to right. Feels more grounded than the quarto standard default.
