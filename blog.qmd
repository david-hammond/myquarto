### Best Practices for API Security

*Posted: January 5, 2024*

Protect your APIs with these essential security practices:

#### Authentication & Authorization

Always use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for authentication:

```javascript
const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: user.id, role: user.role },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '1h' }
);
```

#### Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse:

| Tier | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Anonymous | 10 req/min |
| Authenticated | 100 req/min |
| Premium | 1000 req/min |

#### Input Validation

Always validate and sanitize input:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr

class UserCreate(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: EmailStr
    password: str

    @validator('password')
    def password_strength(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 8:
            raise ValueError('Password too short')
        return v
```
